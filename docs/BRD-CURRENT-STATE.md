- Destructive/Warning colors for alerts and risks (red/orange tones)
- Muted colors for secondary information

**Typography:**
- Responsive font sizing (text-xs to text-3xl)
- Font weights: normal (400), medium (500), bold (700)
- Clear hierarchy with titles, subtitles, and body text

**Spacing:**
- Consistent spacing scale (p-2, p-3, p-4, p-6)
- Responsive spacing adjustments for mobile (sm:p-6)
- Gap spacing for grid layouts (gap-3, gap-4, gap-6)

### 5.2 Component Patterns
**Cards:**
- Used extensively for metric display and content grouping
- Consistent header/content structure
- Responsive padding and sizing

**Badges:**
- Status indicators (Active, Paused, Completed)
- Severity levels (High, Medium, Low Priority)
- ROI performance levels (color-coded by threshold)
- Tier indicators (Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond)

**Buttons:**
- Primary actions: default variant
- Secondary actions: outline variant

└── index.css                         # Global styles
```

### 8.2 Routing Structure
```
/ (root)                              → Redirects to /dashboard
/dashboard                            → Index component (main app)
* (catch-all)                        → NotFound component
```

### 8.3 State Management
**Current Implementation:**
- React useState for local component state
- No global state management (Redux, Zustand, etc.)
- State includes:
  - activeView (string): Current navigation selection
  - selectedPromotion (object): Currently viewed promotion details
  - dialogOpen (boolean): Modal visibility state
  - pagination (number): Current page numbers
  - filters (string): Filter selections

### 8.4 Data Flow
1. User navigates via sidebar → Updates activeView state
2. Index.tsx renderContent() → Renders appropriate dashboard component
3. Component loads → Displays static mock data
4. User interactions → Update local state → Re-render UI

---

**Responsiveness:** Single-page application with instant view switching

### 9.2 Optimization Opportunities
- Code splitting by route/component
- Lazy loading for chart libraries
- Virtual scrolling for large tables
- Memoization of expensive calculations
- Image optimization for assets
